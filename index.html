      <section class="sun-section">
        <h2>The Sun</h2>
        <p><strong>Age: </strong>4.6 Billion Years</p>
        <p><strong>Star Type: </strong>Yellow Dwarf</p>
        <p><strong>Diameter: </strong>1,392,684 Km (109 x Earth)</p>
        <p><strong>Mass: </strong>330,060 x Earth</p>
        <p><strong>Surface Temperature: </strong>5500 °C</p>
        <p><strong>Internal Temperature: </strong>15 Million °C</p>

      <section class="mercury-section">
        <h2>Mercury</h2>
        <p>Mercury is the closest planet to the sun being only 46-70 Million Km away at any given moment.</p>
        <p>Mercury is also the smallest planet in our solar system being only 1.4x bigger than the moon.</p>
        <p>The temperatures on Mercury are very extreme, the coldest are around -180°C and warmest at around 430°C.</p>
        <p>The average day on mercury lasts around 59 earth days whilst having a year that spans just 88 earth days.</p>
        <p>Mercury is also the fastest planet, traveling at 47km/s.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="venus-section">
        <h2>Venus</h2>
        <p>Venus is often considered the "sister" planet or "evil twin" to earth with a similar size and composition to Earth but has an extremely hostile enviroment.</p>
        <p>Venus is the hottest planet with surface temperatures exceeding 482°C.</p>
        <p>Venus has a remarkably slow rotation speed. Venus takes 243 Earth days to complete a full rotation whilst completeing its orbit around the sun in 225 Earth days.</p>
        <p>Venus is also one of few planets that rotate clockwise.</p>
        <p>Alongside the hellish temperatures on Venus, the atmospheric pressure of venus does not disappoint either with the pressure on the surface being about 92x that of Earth.</p>

      <section class="earth-section">
        <h2>Earth</h2>
        <p>Earth's distance from the sun is 149,597,870 Km.</p>
        <p>Earth has a mass of 5.987 x 10^24 kg, making it the largest terrestrial planet in our solor system.</p>
        <p>Earth's solar day is 24 hours. More specifically: 23 Hours 56 Minutes and 4 Seconds.</p>
        <p>Strangely enough, Earth is currently the only known planet to house life in the universe, which gives it the nickname "The Unique Planet".</p>
        <p>Earth's average surface temperature is 15°C.</p>
        <p>Researchers found that 780,000 years ago, the magnetic field was flipped and it remained relatively constant ever since. However, since the 19th century, the northern magnetic pole has shifted 685 miles, indicating that magnetic poles will flip again.</p>

      <section class="moon-section">
        <h2>The Moon</h2>
        <p>The moon is considered a natural satellite as it orbits earth and is the 5th largest moon in our solar system.</p>
        <p>The gravtiy on the moon is around 1/6th of Earth's gravtiy and influences the Earth's tide.</p>
        <p>From Earth, the moon has phases which are the moons appearances from the perspective of Earth. These phases change roughly ever 29.5 days.</p>
        <p>Due to the lack of atmosphere on the moon, the temperatures range from -173°C to 127°C.</p>
        <p>As mentioned above, the atmosphere is near nonexistent, only having trace gases like neon and helium.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="mars-section">
        <h2>Mars</h2>
        <p>Mars is also known as "The Red Planet" thanks to its reddish appearance due to iron oxide.</p>
        <p>Mars has a thin atmosphere which is mostly composed of carbon dioxide with a very low pressure.</p>
        <p>Mars is currently being researched for the potential to hold life and to find past or present microbial life.</p>
        <p>Mars also has polar ice caps like earth, mostly composed of water and carbon dioxide, further pushing scientists to believe that life could have existed in the past or even in the present.</p>
        <p>The day-night cycle is similar to Earth's, having a 24.6 hour day.</p>
        <p>Mars completes its orbit around the sun in 687 days, making the year almost twice as long as it is on Earth.</p>
        <p>A very notiable "feature" of mars is that mars occasionally has a global dust storms.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="jupiter-section">
        <h2>Jupiter</h2>
        <p>Also Known as "The Gas Giant", Jupiter is mostly composed of hydrogen and helium gases and is also the largest planet in our solar system.</p>
        <p>Whilst being the largest planet in our solar system, Jupiter has the shortest day of all planets only being about 10 hours long.</p>
        <p>Jupiter's distinct spot on its surface is known as "The Great Red Spot" which is a persistent storm that is larger than Earth.</p>
        <p>Jupiter also has at least 79 known moons. The largest of which include: Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto.</p>
        <p>Jupiter influences the asteroid belt and even some comets.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="saturn-section">
        <h2>Saturn</h2>
        <p>Saturn is known as "The Ringed Giant" due to its stunning system of rings comprised of ice and rock and also being the second largest planet in our solar system.</p>
        <p>Similar to Jupiter, Saturn is mainly composed of hydrogen and helium gases.</p>
        <p>Also like Jupiter, Saturn spins incredibly fast, having a short day lasting aproximately 10.7 hours.</p>
        <p>Saturn has over 80 known moons, its most famous being Titan.</p>
        <p>One notiable fact about Saturn is that Saturn would float on water due its low density.</p>
        <p>A very strange occurance is that a hexagonal storm pattern has been observed at its north pole.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="uranus-section">
        <h2>Uranus</h2>
        <p>Uranus is a gas giant alongside icy components.</p>
        <p>A unique feature of Uranus is that it tilts nearly perpendicular to its orbit around the sun.</p>
        <p>Uranus has a faint and narrow ring system like saturn.</p>
        <p>Unlike most planets, the magnetic axis is tiled.</p>
        <p>Uranus has a clockwise rotation unlike most planets.</p>
        <p>Uranus is also one of the coldest planets in our solar system with temperatures being around -224°C.</p>
        <p>Uranus possesses 27 known moons, notably Titania and Oberon.</p>
        <p>Uranus has the lowest density of all gas giants.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately Uranus has been visted once by the Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1986.</p>

      <section class="neptune-section">
        <h2>Neptune</h2>
        <p>Known as "The Ice Giant", the planet is mainly composed of water, ammonia, and methane ices with a rocky core.</p>
        <p>Like Jupiter, Neptune also has a spot named "The Great Dark Spot" which is a large transient storm system in its atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Interestingly Neptune was the first planet to be discovered from only mathematical calculations rather than astronomical observations.</p>
        <p>Neptune also has a faint ring system and about 14 known moons, most notably Triton which is the largest moon and the only large moon with a retrograde orbit</p>
        <p>Neptune also has extremely cold temperatures which can drop below -225°C but usually average around -214°C</p>
